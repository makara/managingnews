MANAGING NEWS UPGRADE GUIDE


MANUAL UPGRADE

1) Read the notes on the bottom of this file.

2) Log in as user 1 and put the site in offline mode.

3) Back up your database.

4) Unpack the new Managing News version in a new directory (don't try to
   overwrite your existing site's source code).

5) Copy your existing Managing News site's settings.php and files directory into
   the corresponding places of your new site directory. Make sure you keep the
   permissions consistent.

6) Move your old site directory out of the way and move your new site directory
   into your old site's place. You can alternatively use symbolic links or your
   web server configuration to do this switch. The purpose in the end is that
   when you point your browser to Managing News, it should be served from the
   new code base.

7) Point your browser to your Managing News site's update.php and step through
   the interactive update process. Alternatively run drush updatedb.

8) RUN CRON ONCE. This is particular to Managing News and important for clearing
   all caches. You can run cron manually from admin/reports/status.


AUTOMATIC UPGRADE WITH AEGIR

Managing News can be upgraded (migrated) with Aegir just like any other Drupal
site. No special measures need to be taken.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

Under some circumstances the theme may be disabled during the upgrade, simply
visit admin/build/themes to bring it back.

Any customizations to Views, Data tables, Feeds importers, Open Layers map
configurations or similar that have been undertaken on the Managing News
application before the upgrade may potentially conflict with the upgrade.
Prepare to revert these changes to code and reconfigure them.

To review changes to your Managing News application visit admin/build/features.
